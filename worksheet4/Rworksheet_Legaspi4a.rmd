#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
#A. Describe the data.

#B. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.

gender <- c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M")
shoe <- cbind(shoe_data, gender)

#C. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean(ShoeSize)
mean(Height)

#D. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
